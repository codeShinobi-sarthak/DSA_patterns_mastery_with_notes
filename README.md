# 📘 DSA Pattern Series in Java

This repository contains my personal notes. It's built to help me (and anyone else) prepare for coding interviews by understanding patterns instead of memorizing problems.

> NOTE: Java implementations of common **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) Patterns** are there in another repo [DSA_NOTES](https://github.com/codeShinobi-sarthak/Java-with-DSA)

## 📂 Structure

Each folder represents a DSA pattern or category. Inside, you'll find:

- 💡 Problem explanation and approach
- 🧠 Pattern logic and intuition
- 🔍 Time & Space complexity
- 💻 Java code with comments
- 🧾 Example dry runs

---

## ✅ Patterns Covered

- 🔁 Prefix + HashMap (Subarray with sum, odd/even count, etc.)
- 🔗 Union Find / DSU
- 🌉 Graph Patterns (Tarjan, Kosaraju, MST - Prim’s & Kruskal’s)
- 🔄 Cycle Detection, Connected Components, Flood Fill
- 🧠 Dynamic Programming (State Design, Simulating Forces)
- ⚡ Bit Manipulation
- many more

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Open any folder like `Graphs/`, `DP/`, etc.
2. Read the Java files with explanations in comments
3. Try running them in IntelliJ or any Java IDE
4. Practice similar problems on LeetCode/GFG
