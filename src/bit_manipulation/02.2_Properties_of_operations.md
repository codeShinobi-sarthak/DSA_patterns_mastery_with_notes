## 📜 **Properties of Bitwise Operations**

### **1. Idempotent Law**
- **AND**:  
  \( a \& a = a \)
- **OR**:  
  \( a | a = a \)
- **XOR**:  
  XOR **does not** satisfy this law, because \( a \oplus a = 0 \), not \( a \).

💬 _"When something already exists, applying it again doesn't change it. But XOR removes itself when doubled."_

---

### **2. Commutative Law**
- **AND**:  
  \( a \& b = b \& a \)
- **OR**:  
  \( a | b = b | a \)
- **XOR**:  
  \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \)

💬 _"No matter the order, the outcome remains the same, as long as the players are the same."_ 🌍

---

### **3. Associative Law**
- **AND**:  
  \( (a \& b) \& c = a \& (b \& c) \)
- **OR**:  
  \( (a | b) | c = a | (b | c) \)
- **XOR**:  
  \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \)

💬 _"Groupings don't change the essence. The flow of the operation remains consistent."_ 🌿

---

### **4. Distributive Law**
- **AND over OR**:  
  \( (a \& b) | c = (a | c) \& (b | c) \)
- **OR over AND**:  
  \( (a | b) \& c = (a \& c) | (b \& c) \)
- **XOR over AND**:  
  \( (a \oplus b) \& c = (a \& c) \oplus (b \& c) \)

💬 _"Sometimes operations spread out over others, like sunlight filtering through leaves."_ 🌞

---

### **5. De Morgan’s Laws**
- **NOT of AND**:  
  \( \sim (a \& b) = \sim a | \sim b \)
- **NOT of OR**:  
  \( \sim (a | b) = \sim a \& \sim b \)

💬 _"The world of bits flips! When you negate AND, it becomes OR, and when you negate OR, it turns to AND."_ 🔄

---

### **6. Negative Operation Properties**
- \( -1 = \sim 0 \)
- \( -a = \sim(a - 1) \)

💬 _"To make a number negative, invert and subtract 1. It's a reflection of the positive world."_ 🌓

---

### **7. AND Operation Properties**
- **AND with 0**:  
  \( a \& 0 = 0 \)
- **AND with -1**:  
  \( a \& (-1) = a \)
- **AND with NOT a**:  
  \( a \& \sim a = 0 \)

💬 _"AND with zero makes you vanish, while AND with -1 leaves you unchanged."_  
_"When you AND with the negation of yourself, you become nothing."_ 👥

---

### **8. OR Operation Properties**
- **OR with 0**:  
  \( a | 0 = a \)
- **OR with NOT a**:  
  \( a | \sim a = -1 \)

💬 _"OR with zero does nothing, but OR with your negation becomes infinite — or all ones."_ 💫

---

### **9. XOR Operation Properties**
- **XOR with 0**:  
  \( a \oplus 0 = a \)
- **XOR with itself**:  
  \( a \oplus a = 0 \)

💬 _"XOR with zero keeps you the same, but XOR with yourself erases you."_ ✨

---

### **10. Other Unique Properties**
- **Changing the last `1` in a number**:  
  \( a \& (a - 1) \) — This operation **removes** the **last 1 bit** in the binary representation of `a`.  
  _Example_:  
  `a = 10010000 (binary)`  
  `a - 1 = 10001111 (binary)`  
  \( a \& (a - 1) = 10010000 \& 10001111 = 10000000 \)

💬 _"The operation removes the last bit of light, keeping only what's left."_ 🌑

- **Keep only the last `1` in the number**:  
  \( a \& (-a) \) — This operation **isolates** the **last `1` bit** of `a`.  
  _Example_:  
  `a = 10010000 (binary)`  
  \( -a = \sim (a - 1) = 01110000 \)  
  \( a \& (-a) = 10010000 \& 01110000 = 00010000 \)

💬 _"Only the last bit of light is kept, and all others fade into darkness."_ 🌘

### **Visual Aid of Some Properties**
To give a richer experience, here’s a **flow of the operations** in **binary**:

#### Example: \( a = 10010000 \) (binary)
- \( a \& (a - 1) = 10000000 \)  
  _(Last `1` bit removed)_
- \( a \& (-a) = 00010000 \)  
  _(Last `1` isolated)_

These properties help us with **bit manipulation problems**, enabling more efficient solutions to challenges that would otherwise seem daunting. They are used in algorithms for problems like **finding powers of two**, **counting bits**, **isolating set bits**, and **masking operations**.
