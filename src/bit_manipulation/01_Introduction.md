## 🔶 **PHASE 1 – What is Bit Manipulation?**

### 🌱 1. What is Bit Manipulation?

> **Bit Manipulation** means *performing operations directly on the binary representation* of numbers using **bitwise operators**.

📌 It’s like editing a number *at the bit-level* — turning switches on/off without touching the whole circuit board. 🧠🔌

---

### 🎯 Why Should You Even Bother?

- ⚡ **Speed**: Bitwise operations are super fast — almost O(1).
- 💾 **Memory Efficient**: Great for optimization, like storing states in a single integer.
- 🧩 **Unlocks New Patterns**: Many tricky DSA problems use it — and others become *elegantly simple* once you know how.

### 🧠 2. Binary – The Language of the Machine

Before we mess with bits, let’s speak their language:

#### 🧾 How Numbers Look in Binary

| Decimal | Binary  |
|---------|---------|
|  0      | 0000    |
|  1      | 0001    |
|  2      | 0010    |
|  3      | 0011    |
|  4      | 0100    |
|  5      | 0101    |
|  6      | 0110    |
|  7      | 0111    |
|  8      | 1000    |
|  9      | 1001    |

> Each bit = 2^position  
So:  
`5 = 0101 = 0×8 + 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1 = 4 + 1 = 5`

---

### 🧪 Try it in Java

```java
int x = 5;
System.out.println(Integer.toBinaryString(x)); // prints 101
```

Want to go reverse?

```java
String binary = "101";
int number = Integer.parseInt(binary, 2);
System.out.println(number); // prints 5
```

---

### 🕹️ 3. Binary Intuition — Think in Bits!

Imagine every number as a **row of switches** (bits):

For example, `5` is:

```
Position:   3   2   1   0
Binary:     0   1   0   1
            ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
            8   4   2   1
```

> We’ll soon use this to **check, toggle, and clear** specific bits!

### 🎁 Key Takeaways So Far

- Bit manipulation is powerful and fast ⚡
- All numbers are just a bunch of switches (0s and 1s) 🔘
- You now know how to **see and convert** between decimal and binary in Java 💻
- You’re ready to use binary like a sword 🗡️
