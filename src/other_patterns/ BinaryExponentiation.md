### **1. What is Binary Exponentiation?**

Binary Exponentiation is an optimized method to compute powers of a number. Instead of multiplying the base number repeatedly, we break down the exponent into powers of 2 (binary representation) and use the properties of exponents to speed up the calculation. üî•

### **Why do we need it?**

Without binary exponentiation, calculating large powers would take **O(n)** time, where **n** is the exponent. Using binary exponentiation, we can reduce the time complexity to **O(log n)**, making it way faster! üöÄ

### **2. Key Concept ‚Äì Powers of 2 & Exponentiation**

We know that:
> x^8 = (x^4)^2 
> 
> x^7 = x * (x^3)^2

The idea here is to break down the exponent into **smaller powers of 2**. The binary representation of the exponent helps us do this.

#### Example:
Let‚Äôs take an example with \( x^13 \):
- 13 in binary is **1101**.
- This means  x^{13} = x^8  *  x^4  *  x^1 .

By breaking down the exponent this way, we can multiply the necessary powers without calculating everything from scratch. üòé

### **3. How Binary Exponentiation Works ‚Äì Step-by-Step Explanation**

Let‚Äôs say we want to compute \( x^n \). Here's how we break it down:

1. **Start with the base number \( x \)**.
2. **Iterate through the exponent \( n \)**:
    - If the current exponent is **odd**, we multiply the result by the current base value.
    - Regardless of whether the exponent is even or odd, **square the base** and **halve the exponent**.

This is the iterative approach, and it‚Äôs the heart of **Exponentiation by Squaring**.

---

### **4. Binary Exponentiation Algorithm**

Here‚Äôs the algorithm in pseudocode for **iterative approach**:

```text
Function BinaryExponentiation(x, n):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        if n is odd:
            result = result * x
        x = x * x  # square the base
        n = n // 2  # halve the exponent
    return result
```

### **Explanation of the steps**:
1. We initialize **result** as 1 (the multiplicative identity).
2. While the exponent is greater than 0:
    - If the exponent is odd, multiply the result by the base **x**.
    - Square the base **x** (since we‚Äôre halving the exponent).
    - Halve the exponent (integer division by 2).

Finally, we return **result**, which will be \( x^n \).

---

### **5. Time Complexity** üïí

- **Time complexity**: **O(log n)**, where **n** is the exponent.
    - This is because in each iteration, we halve the exponent, so the number of steps is logarithmic.

---

### **6. Code Example in Java** üíª

Here‚Äôs how you can implement Binary Exponentiation in **Java**:

```java
public class BinaryExponentiation {
    // Function to calculate x^n using binary exponentiation
    public static int binaryExponentiation(int x, int n) {
        int result = 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            // If exponent is odd, multiply the result by x
            if (n % 2 == 1) {
                result *= x;
            }
            // Square the base and halve the exponent
            x *= x;
            n /= 2;
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 2;
        int n = 10;
        System.out.println(binaryExponentiation(x, n)); // Output: 1024
    }
}
```

### **7. Space Complexity** üì¶

- **Space complexity**: **O(1)**, because we are only using a few variables (no additional space for recursion or extra data structures).

---

### **8. Recursive Approach (Optional)**

Here‚Äôs a recursive approach for Binary Exponentiation:

```java
public class BinaryExponentiation {
    // Recursive function to calculate x^n
    public static int binaryExponentiationRecursive(int x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1; // Base case: x^0 = 1
        }
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            return x * binaryExponentiationRecursive(x, n - 1); // If n is odd
        }
        int half = binaryExponentiationRecursive(x, n / 2); // Recursively compute x^(n/2)
        return half * half; // Combine the results
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 2;
        int n = 10;
        System.out.println(binaryExponentiationRecursive(x, n)); // Output: 1024
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**:
- **Base case**: If \( n = 0 \), return 1 because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.
- If \( n \) is odd, reduce \( n \) by 1 and multiply the result by \( x \).
- For even \( n \), calculate \( x^{n/2} \) recursively and square it to get the final result.

The time complexity remains **O(log n)** in the recursive approach as well.

### **9. Example Walkthrough** üöÄ

Let's go through an example: **x = 3, n = 13**.

#### Steps:
1. **x = 3, n = 13 (binary: 1101)**
2. \( n \) is odd, so multiply result by \( x \): **result = 1 * 3 = 3**.
3. Square the base: \( x = 3^2 = 9 \).
4. Halve the exponent: \( n = 13 // 2 = 6 \).

Repeat these steps:
- \( n = 6 \) is even: no change in result, square \( x \), halve \( n \).
- \( n = 3 \) is odd: multiply result by \( x \), square \( x \), halve \( n \).
- \( n = 1 \) is odd: multiply result by \( x \), square \( x \), halve \( n \).

Final result is \( 3^{13} = 1594323 \).

- **Computing powers** in cryptography algorithms (RSA).
- **Modular exponentiation** (e.g., calculating large powers modulo a number).
- **Finding Fibonacci numbers** (optimizing the process using matrix exponentiation).
- **Optimizing calculations in graph theory and number theory** problems.

### **Summary**
